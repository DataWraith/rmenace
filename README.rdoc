= rMENACE

The "Matchbox Educable Noughts-and-Crosses Engine" and other TicTacToe playing
strategies, written in Ruby.


== Introduction

rMENACE is a little toy project to help me learn Ruby and dip my toes into the
waters of Behaviour Driven Development. It consists of several classes that
implement algorithms for playing TicTacToe using a simple grid-class.


== How to play

[User interface not yet implemented]


== The strategies

* Player

	Plays into the first free square starting from top-left. This isn't
	supposed to be a real playing strategy; Player is just the base-class
	from which all other players are derived, so it needed a
	make_move()-function.

* RandomPlayer

	Plays randomly.

* RandomFinishPlayer

	Plays randomly, but connects three if possible.

* CenterRandomPlayer

	Plays center if possible, otherwise plays randomly.

* MinimaxPlayer

	A perfect player that examines all possible move-sequences using the
	Minimax algorithm.

* SimpleLearner

	Copies winning move-sequences. Whenever a player wins, SimpleLearner
	saves the move-sequence. In subsequent matches, it will try to follow
	these move-sequences as far as its opponent will let it. It will also try
	to prevent the opponent from following a known winning-sequence.

	If it doesn't have a sequence to follow/thwart, it will play randomly.

* MENACE (not yet implemented)

	Donald Michie's Matchbox Educable Noughts-and-Crosses Engine algorithm.
	Michie used matchboxes to represent every possible game-grid, and every
	matchbox contained colored beads that represented one of the possible
	moves.

	If MENACE wins, additional beads are placed into the matchboxes, so
	that it becomes more probable for MENACE to choose the same move
	sequence that led to victory again.

	If MENACE loses, the beads that were drawn to determine MENACE's moves
	are not put back into the matchboxes, making it less likely that it will
	repeat the losing move sequence.
